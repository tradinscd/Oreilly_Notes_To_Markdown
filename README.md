# O'Reilly Online Notes To Markdown

Converts an export of O'Reilly Online [Notes](https://learning.oreilly.com/highlights/?page=1) to markdown formated for my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) notes.

O'Reilly Online offers a easy way to highlight text and add notes in all of their online books. The purpose of this repo is to take those highlights and notes and convert them into a specific format I use in my Obsidian notes.

## How to use

1. Get your highlights from [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/highlights/?page=1)
2. Download the export csv of your highlights to the same directory as `main.py`
3. Run `main.py``
4. Use copy/paste each note into Obsidian
